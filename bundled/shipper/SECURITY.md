# shipper ★ — Security model

## Surface

shipper's Bash surface is **larger than verifier ★** (3 of 4 dispatched steps grant Bash vs 1 of 4). Concretely:

- **Step 1 — read-only git probes** (`bundled/shipper/prompts/subagent/shipper_preflight_step1.md`). Bash invokes `python3` only; all git calls go through `server.git_helpers` argv-list wrappers (`git_status_porcelain`, `git_head_sha`, `git_branch`). NO direct `git` CLI.
- **Step 2 — Edit/Write only** (`shipper_version_step2.md`). NO Bash. Mutates the version file (VERSION / package.json / pyproject.toml) + `CHANGELOG.md` exclusively via the Edit/Write tools. This is the only Bash-free step in shipper.
- **Step 3 — single build command** (`shipper_build_step3.md`). One bash one-liner from `parsed_scope.build`, executed via `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)` with TIMEOUT_S=300, per-stream CAP_BYTES=500_000 streaming cap, process-group SIGKILL on timeout or cap-hit. Spike VIII verifier FIX-1 streaming pattern inherited (10× timeout, 5× cap).
- **Step 4 — local annotated tag creation** (`shipper_tag_step4.md`). `git tag -a <name> -m <message>` via `server.git_helpers.git_create_tag` argv-list wrapper. NEVER `-f`, NEVER `git push`, NEVER any remote interaction.

The `Bash tool access GRANTED` substring marker (Spike VIII convention) appears in Steps 1, 3, 4 prompt bodies as the canonical grep target for security audits.

## Threat model

| # | Threat | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Malicious SCOPE author injects destructive build payload (`rm -rf`, `> /dev/sda`) | low-med | length cap 500 on `build` field (`_BUILD_MAX_LEN` in `server/scope_parser.py:58`); SCOPE author trust scope = repo owner / equivalent trusted principal; same model as `make`/`npm test`. Untrusted contributors (open-source PRs adding SCOPE.md) introduce supply-chain risk equivalent to merging untrusted CI scripts. |
| T2 | Runaway build blocks pipeline | medium | `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)` + streaming `select.select` read loop with TIMEOUT_S=300; on timeout, full process group killed via `os.killpg(SIGKILL)` (Codex retro F2/F3 inheritance — prevents `bash -c 'cmd &'` from surviving past timeout). exit_code=124 (GNU coreutils convention), `timed_out: true` recorded. |
| T3 | Build output flood saturates RAM (e.g. `yes \| head -c 10G`) | medium | **MITIGATED** — streaming read with per-stream byte counter inside `select.select` loop; child killed (process-group SIGKILL) immediately when either stream hits CAP_BYTES=500_000. Wrapper RAM bound = 1MB (CAP_BYTES × 2 streams). FIX-1 inheritance, 5× verifier cap. |
| T4 | Build artifact dropped in unexpected location | low | shipper does not consume build output paths — only exit code + bounded stdout/stderr capture. Artifact placement is build-tool's concern, surfaced in SHIP_REPORT §Hand-off, not auto-uploaded. |
| T5 | `git tag` collides with existing tag | medium | Step 4 pre-checks `server.git_helpers.git_tag_exists(cwd, tag_name)` BEFORE creating; collision aborts with `verdict: blocked (tag)` and renders the abort template. |
| T6 | `git tag -f` overwriting existing tag | high | Step 4 prompt body explicitly forbids `-f` / `--force`. `server.git_helpers.git_create_tag` always invokes `git tag -a` (annotated, no force). Harness preamble v3 surgical-changes rule reinforces. |
| T7 | Tag pushed to remote unintentionally | high | Step 4 prompt body explicitly forbids ANY form of `git push` / `git fetch` / `git pull`. SHIP_REPORT §Hand-off documents `git push origin <tag>` as a user-owned next-step command, never auto-invoked. |
| T8 | Pre-flight Bash escape (`git status; rm -rf /`) | high | Step 1 uses argv-list invocation only via `server.git_helpers.*` (`subprocess.run(["git", *args], shell=False)`). NO `shell=True`, NO string interpolation, NO `os.system`. argv-list grep gate test (`test_module_has_no_shell_true_or_os_system`) asserts source-level invariant. |
| T9 | Pre-flight reads outside repo | low | git probes scoped to `cwd` (assemble repo or run_dir parent). Cross-repo workflows (Step 1 probing repo A while Step 4 tagging repo B) are explicitly NOT supported in V4 — single-repo invariant. |

## Mitigations enumerated

1. **Length cap 500** — Step 1 enforces on `parsed_scope.build` field. Schema cap is `_BUILD_MAX_LEN = 500` in `server/scope_parser.py:58`; oversize inputs surface as `build-too-long` error label and Step 3 skips execution.
2. **Timeout 300s** — Step 3 wraps build in `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)` + streaming `select.select` loop with `TIMEOUT_S=300` (`bundled/shipper/prompts/subagent/shipper_build_step3.md:43`). On timeout, full process group killed via `os.killpg(os.getpgid(proc.pid), signal.SIGKILL)`. exit_code=124, `timed_out: true` recorded. Verifier FIX-1 inheritance with 10× timeout.
3. **Output cap 500KB streaming** — Step 3 per-stream byte counter (`CAP_BYTES = 500_000`, line 42) inside the `select.select` loop. Child killed (process-group SIGKILL) immediately when either stream hits cap. Wrapper RAM bound = 1MB regardless of build output size (a 10GB build log cannot OOM the sub-agent). FIX-1 inheritance with 5× verifier cap.
4. **argv-list git invocation** — `server/git_helpers.py` ALL functions use `subprocess.run(["git", *args], shell=False)`. NO string command construction, NO `os.system`. Grep-gate test asserts NO `shell=True` / `os.system(` substring in module source.
5. **`git tag -a` only, NEVER `-f`** — Step 4 prompt body explicitly forbids `-f` / `--force` flags. `server.git_helpers.git_create_tag` validates `tag_name` BEFORE invoking git (rejects empty / whitespace / leading-dash / `..` substring with `ValueError`), then runs `git tag -a <name> -m <message>` only. Even though argv-list invocation already neutralizes shell metacharacters, leading-dash rejection blocks `--force` from being smuggled through `tag_name`.
6. **NEVER `git push`** — Step 4 prompt body forbids ANY remote operation (`push`, `fetch`, `pull`). SHIP_REPORT §Hand-off documents push as a user-owned next-step command; the shipper bundle never auto-invokes it.
7. **Bash scoped to Steps 1, 3, 4** — Step 2 sub-agent does NOT receive Bash tool access (Edit/Write only). The `ALLOWED_PROMPT_FILES` allowlist in `server/harness.py` enumerates exactly 4 shipper subagent prompts; non-allowlisted dispatch raises `ValueError` (Spike VIII allowlist mechanism).
8. **Orchestrator-only main** — main Claude does NOT call Bash directly during the dispatch chain. Main only dispatches sub-agents. (V4 #9 invariant + Spike VIII enforcement; verified via `dispatches.jsonl` introspection in B-14 dogfood AC10.)

## Allowlist enforcement gate

`server.harness.ALLOWED_PROMPT_FILES` (frozenset) is enforced at `dispatch_prompt(prompt_file)` call time, NOT at `_resolve_prompt_path(prompt_file)` resolution time. Concretely:

- **`dispatch_prompt`** — checks the allowlist; raises `ValueError` if `prompt_file` is not in the frozenset. This is the gate for sub-agent dispatch (Bash grant goes through this).
- **`_resolve_prompt_path`** — does filesystem lookup only; iterates ALL bundles' `prompts/subagent/` dirs and returns the first match. Does NOT check the allowlist. This is intentional for orchestrator helpers loaded by main directly.

**Implication** (Codex retro F8 inheritance): a new prompt file added to any `prompts/subagent/` directory is resolvable by `_resolve_prompt_path` regardless of allowlist status. Such a file would only receive Bash access if dispatched via `dispatch_prompt`, which DOES check the allowlist. Filesystem placement (controlled by repo write access) is the secondary gate.

`shipper_iter_revisit.md` is intentionally outside `ALLOWED_PROMPT_FILES` because it is an orchestrator helper loaded by main (not a sub-agent dispatched prompt). Its placement under `prompts/orchestrator/` (not `prompts/subagent/`) further documents this distinction. It is registered in `ORCHESTRATOR_ONLY_PROMPTS` (Spike VIII Pre-IX FIX-3 contract).

## Explicit non-goals

- **No publish / push automation.** SHIP_REPORT §Hand-off documents `git push origin <branch> && git push origin <tag>`, `npm publish`, `python -m twine upload`, App Store / Play Console upload, gstack `/land-and-deploy` chain — all as user-owned next steps. NEVER `git push`, NEVER `npm publish`, NEVER cloud deploy commands inside the shipper bundle.
- **No multi-language version bumping** — only the 3 most common formats (VERSION / package.json / pyproject.toml) are detected by `server.version_helpers`. Cargo / Gem / Composer / etc. fall back to manual user edit before invoking shipper.
- **No remote interaction at all** — Step 4 specifically forbids `git push`, `git fetch`, `git pull`. The annotated tag is local-only. Pushing it is the user's deliberate decision.
- **No `git tag -f` overwrite path** — duplicate tag → abort with `verdict: blocked (tag)`. User manually deletes the stale tag (`git tag -d`) or bumps the version before retrying.
- **No sandboxing (chroot/firejail/cgroups/namespaces)** — out of V4 scope. Steps 1, 3, 4 run with the same OS-level privileges as the rest of the dispatch chain.
- **No secret scrubbing** — SCOPE author's responsibility to keep secrets out of `## Build` commands and CHANGELOG entries (same convention as commit messages).
- **No shell metacharacter denylist.** Denylists leak. argv-list invocation (Step 1, Step 4) + cap+timeout+author-trust (Step 3) matches the trust model of CI runners and build tools.

## Known limitations

### T6 — Detached process timeout bypass (low residual risk, partially mitigated)

`start_new_session=True` + `os.killpg(SIGKILL)` in Step 3's timeout / cap-hit handler kills the entire process group, addressing `&` background operator, `nohup`, `disown`, `setsid`, `setpgrp` variants. Remaining un-mitigated bypasses:

- **`at now` / `crontab`** — schedules work for future execution via system daemons (`atd`, `cron`); these run outside shipper's process group entirely. NOT mitigated. Acceptable risk under SCOPE author trust model.
- **`systemd-run --user`** — spawns under a different cgroup. NOT mitigated. Acceptable risk.

Full process isolation (cgroups, namespaces) would be required to close these — out of V4 scope.

### Cross-repo workflows

`cwd` is assumed to be the assemble repo or whatever orchestrator launched from. Cross-repo flows (Step 1 probing one repo while Step 4 tagging another) are NOT supported. Single-repo invariant. SCOPE author specifying a `git_repo` field for cross-repo workflows is explicitly deferred to Spike X.

## Codex retro gate

Spike IX Phase E (MANDATORY per user directive on security-sensitive publish/push surface) dispatches `codex:codex-rescue` for adversarial review of:

- Threat table T1–T9 completeness vs the actual Step 1/3/4 prompt bodies and `server.git_helpers` source.
- Step 1 argv-list git invocation surface (T8 — confirm no `shell=True` / no string concat / no `os.system`).
- Step 3 streaming Popen pattern (T2/T3 — verify FIX-1 fidelity: TIMEOUT_S=300, CAP_BYTES=500_000, process-group SIGKILL).
- Step 4 `git tag` invocation (T5/T6/T7 — confirm no `-f`, no `push`, no remote interaction).
- SECURITY.md hand-off boundary completeness (no implicit publish path).

Findings either close as documented "non-goal" (amend §Explicit non-goals) or amend code/SECURITY.md before B-14 ship. The `Bash tool access GRANTED` substring marker is the canonical grep target — Codex verifies presence in Steps 1, 3, 4 prompt bodies and absence in Step 2.
